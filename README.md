# Augspurger Synchrony
A single function to calculate Augspurgers index of synchrony after Primack 1980. This function very warmly, and humbly, acknowledges Carol Augspurger, or 'Dr. A' as many alumni of UIUC have the privilege to know her. One of the few ecologists, to be both a great Natural Historian, accomplished academic, excellent instructor, and unparalled mentor.


This all from Augspurger 1983.

> ## APPENDIX 1. Methods of Calculating Synchrony (modified from Primack 1980).
>
> **A.** Synchrony of a given individual with its conspecifics:
>  $X_{i}$, the index of synchrony for individual i, is defined
>  
> $$
> X_{i} = (\frac{1}{n-1})(\frac{1}{f_{i}})\sum_{j = i}^{n} e_{j != i}
> $$
>
> where, 
>
>  $e_{j}$ = number of days both individuals i and j are flowering synchronously,  *j* != *i*  
>  $f_{i}$ = number of days individual i is flowering  
>  $n$ = number of individuals in population  
> 
> When X = 1.0, perfect synchrony occurs, i.e., all flowering days of individual i overlap with all flowering days of each other individual, j # i, in the > population.  
> When X = 0.0, no synchrony occurs, i.e., no overlap occurs among any of the flowering days of individual i and any other individual, j =# i, in the > population.  
>
> **B.** Synchrony of the population:
>  $Z$, the index of population synchrony, is defined as:
> 
> $$
> Z= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j = 1}^{n}X_{i}
> $$
>
> $\frac{1}{n}$
>
> where $X_{i}$ is synchrony of individual *i* with its conspecifics from part A (above)
